abstract: Summary Peptide-HLA (pHLA) binding prediction is essential in screening
  peptide candidates for personalized peptide vaccines. Machine learning (ML) pHLA
  binding prediction tools are trained on vast amounts of data and are effective in
  screening peptide candidates. Most ML models report the ability to generalize to
  HLA alleles unseen during training (\"pan-allele\" models). However, the use of
  datasets with imbalanced allele content raises concerns about biased model performance.
  First, we examine the data bias of two ML-based pan-allele pHLA binding predictors.
  We find that the pHLA datasets overrepresent alleles from geographic populations
  of high-income countries. Second, we show that the identified data bias is perpetuated
  within ML models, leading to algorithmic bias and subpar performance for alleles
  expressed in low-income geographic populations. We draw attention to the potential
  therapeutic consequences of this bias, and we challenge the use of the term “pan-allele”
  to describe models trained with currently available public datasets.
