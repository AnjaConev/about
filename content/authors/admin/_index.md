# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I apply artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) techniques to the problems in the field of computational structural biology with the goal of aiding drug discovery. In particular, the computational problems I explored include the design of ML-driven molecular scoring functions, search approaches in molecular docking, analysis and visualization of the data generated by biomolecular and macromolecular simulations.
